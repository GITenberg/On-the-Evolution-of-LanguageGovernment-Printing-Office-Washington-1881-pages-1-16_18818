<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Possible ideas and thoughts are vast in number. A distinct word for
every distinct idea and thought would require a vast vocabulary. The
problem in language is to express many ideas and thoughts with
comparatively few words.</p>

<p>Again, in the evolution of any language, progress is from a condition
where few ideas are expressed by a few words to a higher, where many
ideas are expressed by the use of many words; but the number of all
possible ideas or thoughts expressed is increased greatly out of
proportion with the increase of the number of words.</p>

<p>And still again, in all of those languages which have been most
thoroughly studied, and by inference in all languages, it appears that
the few original words used in any language remain as the elements for
the greater number finally used. In the evolution of a language the
introduction of absolutely new material is a comparatively rare
phenomenon. The old material is combined and modified in many ways to
form the new.</p>

<p>How has the small stock of words found as the basis of a language
been thus combined and modified?</p>

<p>The way in which the old materials have been used gives rise to what
will here be denominated <span class = "smallroman">THE GRAMMATIC
PROCESSES</span>.</p>


<h4 class = "section">I.&mdash;THE PROCESS BY COMBINATION.</h4>

<p>Two or more words may be united to form a new one, or to perform the
office of a new one, and four methods or stages of combination may be
noted.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> By <i>juxtaposition</i>, where the two words are placed
together and yet remain as distinct words. This method is illustrated in
Chinese, where the words in the combination when taken alone seldom give
a clew to their meaning when placed together.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> By <i>compounding</i>, where two words are made into one,
in which case the original elements of the new word remain in an
unmodified condition, as in <i>house-top</i>, <i>rain-bow</i>,
<i>tell-tale</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page004"> </a>
<i>c.</i> By <i>agglutination</i>, in which case one or more of the
elements entering into combination to form the new word is somewhat
changed&mdash;the elements are fused together. Yet this modification is
not so great as to essentially obscure the primitive words, as in
<i>truthful</i>, where we easily recognize the original words
<i>truth</i> and <i>full</i>; and <i>holiday</i>, in which <i>holy</i>
and <i>day</i> are recognized.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> By <i>inflection</i>. Here one or more of the elements
entering into the compound has been so changed that it can scarcely be
recognized. There is a constant tendency to economy in speech by which
words are gradually shortened as they are spoken by generation after
generation. In those words which are combinations of others there are
certain elements that wear out more rapidly than others. Where some
particular word is combined with many other different words the tendency
to modify by wear this oft-used element is great. This is more
especially the case where the combined word is used in certain
categories of combinations, as where particular words are used to denote
tense in the verb; thus, <i>did</i> may be used in combination with a
verb to denote past time until it is worn down to the sound of <i>d</i>.
The same wear occurs where particular words are used to form cases in
nouns, and a variety of illustrations might be given. These categories
constitute conjugations and declensions, and for convenience such
combinations may be called paradigmatic. Then the oft-repeated elements
of paradigmatic combinations are apt to become excessively worn and
modified, so that the primitive words or themes to which they are
attached seem to be but slightly changed by the addition. Under these
circumstances combination is called inflection.</p>

<p>As a morphologic process, no well-defined plane of demarkation
between these four methods of combination can be drawn, as one runs into
another; but, in general, words may be said to be juxtaposed when two
words being placed together the combination performs the function of a
new word, while in form the two words remain separate.</p>

<p>Words may be said to be compound when two or more words are combined
to form one, no change being made in either. Words maybe said to be
agglutinated when the elementary words are changed but slightly,
<i>i.e.</i>, only to the extent that their original forms are not
greatly obscured; and words may be said to be inflected when in the
combination the oft-repeated element or formative part has been so
changed that its origin is obscured. These inflections are used chiefly
in the paradigmatic combinations.</p>

<p>In the preceding statement it has been assumed that there can be
recognized, in these combinations of inflection, a theme or root, as it
is sometimes called, and a formative element. The formative element is
used with a great many different words to define or qualify them; that
is, to indicate mode, tense, number, person, gender, etc., of verbs,
nouns, and other parts of speech.</p>

<p>When in a language juxtaposition is the chief method of combination,
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page005"> </a>
there may also be distinguished two kinds of elements, in some sense
corresponding to themes and formative parts. The theme is a word the
meaning of which is determined by the formative word placed by it; that
is, the theme is a word having many radically different meanings; with
which meaning it is to be understood is determined only by the formative
word, which thus serves as its label. The ways in which the theme words
are thus labeled by the formative word are very curious, but the subject
cannot be entered into here.</p>

<p>When words are combined by compounding, the formative elements cannot
so readily be distinguished from the theme; nor for the purposes under
immediate consideration can compounding be well separated from
agglutination.</p>

<p>When words are combined by agglutination, theme and formative part
usually appear. The formative parts are affixes; and affixes may be
divided into three classes, prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. These
affixes are often called incorporated particles.</p>

<p>In those Indian languages where combination is chiefly by
agglutination, that is, by the use of affixes, <i>i.e.</i>, incorporated
particles, certain parts of the conjugation of the verb, especially
those which denote gender, number, and person, are effected by the use
of article pronouns; but in those languages where article pronouns are
not found the verbs are inflected to accomplish the same part of their
conjugation. Perhaps, when we come more fully to study the formative
elements in these more highly inflected languages, we may discover in
such elements greatly modified, <i>i.e.</i>, worn out, incorporated
pronouns.</p>


<h4 class = "section">II.&mdash;THE PROCESS BY VOCALIC MUTATION.</h4>

<p>Here, in order to form a new word, one or more of the vowels of the
old word are changed, as in <i>man&mdash;men</i>, where an <i>e</i> is
substituted for <i>a</i>; <i>ran&mdash;run</i>, where <i>u</i> is
substituted for <i>a</i>; <i>lead&mdash;led</i>, where <i>e</i>, with
its proper sound, is substituted for <i>ea</i> with its proper sound.
This method is used to a very limited extent in English. When the
history of the words in which it occurs is studied it is discovered to
be but an instance of the wearing out of the different elements of
combined words; but in the Hebrew this method prevails to a very large
extent, and scholars have not yet been able to discover its origin in
combination as they have in English. It may or may not have been an
original grammatic process, but because of its importance in certain
languages it has been found necessary to deal with it as a distinct and
original process.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page006"> </a>
<h4 class = "section">III.&mdash;THE PROCESS BY INTONATION.</h4>

<p>In English, new words are not formed by this method, yet words are
intoned for certain purposes, chiefly rhetorical. We use the rising
intonation (or&nbsp;inflection, as it is usually called) to indicate
that a question is asked, and various effects are given to speech by the
various intonations of rhetoric. But this process is used in other
languages to form new words with which to express new ideas. In Chinese
eight distinct intonations are found, by the use of which one word may
be made to express eight different ideas, or perhaps it is better to say
that eight words may be made of one.</p>


<h4 class = "section">IV.&mdash;THE PROCESS BY PLACEMENT.</h4>

<p>The place or position of a word may affect its significant use. Thus
in English we say <i>John struck James</i>. By the position of those
words to each other we know that John is the actor, and that James
receives the action.</p>

<p>By the grammatic processes language is organized. Organization
postulates the differentiation of organs and their combination into
integers. The integers of language are sentences, and their organs are
the parts of speech. Linguistic organization, then, consists in the
differentiation of the parts of speech and the integration of the
sentence. For example, let us take the words <i>John</i>, <i>father</i>,
and <i>love</i>. <i>John</i> is the name of an individual; <i>love</i>
is the name of a mental action, and <i>father</i> the name of a person.
We put them together, John loves father, and they express a thought;
<i>John</i> becomes a noun, and is the subject of the sentence;
<i>love</i> becomes a verb, and is the predicant; <i>father</i> a noun,
and is the object; and we now have an organized sentence. A sentence
requires parts of speech, and parts of speech are such because they are
used as the organic elements of a sentence.</p>

<p>The criteria of rank in languages are, first, grade of organization,
<i>i.e.</i>, the degree to which the grammatic processes and methods are
specialized, and the parts of speech differentiated; second, sematologic
content, that is, the body of thought which the language is competent to
convey.</p>

<p>The grammatic processes may be used for three purposes:</p>

<p>First, for <i>derivation</i>, where a new word to express a new idea
is made by combining two or more old words, or by changing the vowel of
one word, or by changing the intonation of one word.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page007"> </a>
Second, for <i>modification</i>, a word may be qualified or defined by
the processes of combination, vocalic mutation or intonation.</p>

<p>It should here be noted that the plane between derivation and
qualification is not absolute.</p>

<p>Third, for <i>relation</i>. When words as signs of ideas are used
together to express thought, the relation of the words must be expressed
by some means. In English the relation of words is expressed both by
placement and combination, <i>i.e.</i>, inflection for agreement.</p>

<p>It should here be noted that paradigmatic inflections are used for
two distinct purposes, qualification and relation. A word is qualified
by inflection when the idea expressed by the inflection pertains to the
idea expressed by the word inflected; thus a noun is qualified by
inflection when its number and gender are expressed. A word is related
by inflection when the office of the word in the sentence is pointed out
thereby; thus, nouns are related by case inflections; verbs are related
by inflections for gender, number, and person. All inflection for
agreement is inflection for relation.</p>

<p>In English, three of the grammatic processes are highly
specialized.</p>

<p><i>Combination</i> is used chiefly for derivation, but to some slight
extent for qualification and relation in the paradigmatic categories.
But its use in this manner as compared with many other languages has
almost disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Vocalic mutation</i> is used to a very limited extent and only by
accident, and can scarcely be said to belong to the English
language.</p>

<p><i>Intonation</i> is used as a grammatic process only to a limited
extent&mdash;simply to assist in forming the interrogative and
imperative modes. Its use here is almost rhetorical; in all other cases
it is purely rhetorical.</p>

<p><i>Placement</i> is largely used in the language, and is highly
specialized, performing the office of exhibiting the relations of words
to each other in the sentence; <i>i.e.</i>, it is used chiefly for
syntactic relation.</p>

<p>Thus one of the four processes does not belong to the English
language; the others are highly specialized.</p>

<p>The purposes for which the processes are used are <i>derivation</i>,
<i>modification</i>, and <i>syntactic relation</i>.</p>

<p><i>Derivation</i> is accomplished by combination.</p>

<p><i>Modification</i> is accomplished by the differentiation of
adjectives and adverbs, as words, phrases, and clauses.</p>

<p><i>Syntactic relation</i> is accomplished by placement. Syntactic
relation must not be confounded with the relation expressed by
prepositions. Syntactic relation is the relation of the parts of speech
to each other as integral parts of a sentence. Prepositions express
relations of thought of another order. They relate words to each other
as words.</p>

<p>Placement relates words to each other as parts of speech.</p>

<p>In the Indian tongues combination is used for all three purposes,
performing the three different functions of derivation, modification,
and relation.
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page008"> </a>
Placement, also, is used for relation, and for both lands of relation,
syntactic and prepositional.</p>

<p>With regard, then, to the processes and purposes for which they are
used, we find in the Indian languages a low degree of specialization;
processes are used for diverse purposes, and purposes are accomplished
by diverse processes.</p>


<h4 class = "section">DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.</h4>

<p>It is next in order to consider to what degree the parts of speech
are differentiated in Indian languages, as compared with English.</p>

<p>Indian nouns are extremely connotive, that is, the name does more
than simply denote the thing to which it belongs; in denoting the object
it also assigns to it some quality or characteristic. Every object has
many qualities and characteristics, and by describing but a part of
these the true office of the noun is but imperfectly performed. A
strictly denotive name expresses no one quality or character, but
embraces all qualities and characters.</p>

<p>In <i>Ute</i> the name for bear is <i>he seizes</i>, or <i>the
hugger</i>. In this case the verb is used for the noun, and in so doing
the Indian names the bear by predicating one of his characteristics.
Thus noun and verb are undifferentiated. In <i>Seneca</i> the north is
<i>the sun never goes there</i>, and this sentence may be used as
adjective or noun; in such cases noun, adjective, verb, and adverb are
found as one vocable or word, and the four parts of speech are
undifferentiated. In the <i>Pav&auml;nt</i> language a school-house is
called
<i>p&oacute;-k&ucirc;nt-&icirc;n-&icirc;&ntilde;-y&icirc;-k&auml;n</i>.
The first part of the word, <i>p&oacute;-k&ucirc;nt</i>, signifies
<i>sorcery is practiced</i>, and is the name given by the Indians to any
writing, from the fact that when they first learned of writing they
supposed it to be a method of practicing sorcery;
<i>&icirc;n-&icirc;&ntilde;-y&icirc;</i> is the verb signifying <i>to
count</i>, and the meaning of the word has been extended so as to
signify <i>to read</i>; <i>k&auml;n</i> signifies wigwam, and is derived
from the verb <i>k&uuml;ri</i>, <i>to stay</i>. Thus the name of the
school-house literally signifies <i>a staying place where sorcery is
counted</i>, or where papers are read. The <i>Pav&auml;nt</i> in naming
a school-house describes the purpose for which it is used. These
examples illustrate the general characteristics of Indian nouns; they
are excessively connotive; a simply denotive name is rarely found. In
general their name-words predicate some attribute of the object named,
and thus noun, adjective, and predicant are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>In many Indian languages there is no separate word for <i>eye</i>,
<i>hand</i>, <i>arm</i>, or other parts and organs of the body, but the
word is found with an incorporated or attached pronoun signifying
<i>my</i> hand, <i>my</i> eye; <i>your</i> hand, <i>your</i> eye;
<i>his</i> hand, <i>his</i> eye, etc., as the case may be. If the
Indian, in naming these parts, refers to his own body, he says
<i>my</i>; if he refers to
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page009"> </a>
the body of the person to whom he is speaking, he says <i>your</i>,
&amp;c. If an Indian should find a detached foot thrown from the
amputating-table of an army field hospital, he would say something like
this: I have found somebody <i>his foot</i>. The linguistic
characteristic is widely spread, though not universal.</p>

<p>Thus the Indian has no command of a fully differentiated noun
expressive of <i>eye</i>, <i>hand</i>, <i>arm</i>, or other parts and
organs of the body.</p>

<p>In the pronouns we often have the most difficult part of an Indian
language. Pronouns are only to a limited extent independent words.</p>

<p>Among the free pronouns the student must early learn to distinguish
between the personal and the demonstrative. The demonstrative pronouns
are more commonly used. The Indian is more accustomed to say <i>this</i>
person or thing, <i>that</i> person or thing, than <i>he</i>,
<i>she</i>, or <i>it</i>. Among the free personal pronouns the student
may find an equivalent of the pronoun <i>I</i>, another signifying <i>I
and you</i>; perhaps another signifying <i>I and he</i>, and one
signifying <i>we, more than two</i>, including the speaker and those
present; and another including the speaker and persons absent. He will
also find personal pronouns in the second and third person, perhaps with
singular, dual, and plural forms.</p>

<p>To a large extent the pronouns are incorporated in the verbs as
prefixes, infixes, or suffixes. In such cases we will call them article
pronouns. These article pronouns point out with great particularity the
person, number, and gender, both of subject and object, and sometimes of
the indirect object. When the article pronouns are used the personal
pronouns may or may not be used; but it is believed that the personal
pronouns will always be found. Article pronouns may not always be found.
In those languages which are characterized by them they are used alike
when the subject and object nouns are expressed and when they are not.
The student may at first find some difficulty with these article
pronouns. Singular, dual, and plural forms will be found. Sometimes
distinct incorporated particles will be used for subject and object, but
often this will not be the case. If the subject only is expressed, one
particle may be used; if the object only is expressed, another particle;
but if subject and object are expressed an entirely different particle
may stand for both.</p>

<p>But it is in the genders of these article pronouns that the greatest
difficulty may be found. The student must entirely free his mind of the
idea that gender is simply a distinction of sex. In Indian tongues,
genders are usually methods of classification primarily into animate and
inanimate. The animate may be again divided into male and female, but
this is rarely the case. Often by these genders all objects are
classified by characteristics found in their attitudes or supposed
constitution. Thus we may have the animate and inanimate, one or both,
divided into the <i>standing</i>, the <i>sitting</i>, and the
<i>lying</i>; or they may be divided into the <i>watery</i>, the
<i>mushy</i>, the <i>earthy</i>, the <i>stony</i>, the <i>woody</i>, and
the <i>fleshy</i>. The gender of these article pronouns has rarely been
worked out in any
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page010"> </a>
language. The extent to which these classifications enter into the
article pronouns is not well known. The subject requires more thorough
study. These incorporated particles are here called <i>article</i>
pronouns. In the conjugation of the verb they take an important part,
and have by some writers been called <i>transitions</i>. Besides
pointing out with particularity the person, number, and gender or the
subject and object, they perform the same offices that are usually
performed by those inflections of the verb that occur to make them agree
in gender, number, and person with the subject. In those Indian
languages where the article pronouns are not found, and the personal
pronouns only are used, the verb is usually inflected to agree with the
subject or object, or both, in the same particulars.</p>

<p>The article pronouns as they point out person, number, gender, and
case of the subject and object, are not simple particles, but are to a
greater or lesser extent compound; their component elements may be
broken apart and placed in different parts of the verb. Again, the
article pronoun in some languages may have its elements combined into a
distinct word in such a manner that it will not be incorporated in the
verb, but will be placed immediately before it. For this reason the term
<i>article pronoun</i> has been chosen rather than <i>attached
pronoun</i>. The older term, <i>transition</i>, was given to them
because of their analogy in function to verbal inflections.</p>

<p>Thus the verb of an Indian language contains within itself
incorporated article pronouns which point out with great particularity
the gender, number, and person of the subject and object. In this manner
verb, pronoun, and adjective are combined, and to this extent these
parts of speech are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>In some languages the article pronoun constitutes a distinct word,
but whether free or incorporated it is a complex tissue of
adjectives.</p>

<p>Again, nouns sometimes contain particles within themselves to
predicate possession, and to this extent nouns and verbs are
undifferentiated.</p>

<p>The verb is relatively of much greater importance in an Indian tongue
than in a civilized language. To a large extent the pronoun is
incorporated in the verb as explained above, and thus constitutes a part
of its conjugation.</p>

<p>Again, adjectives are used as intransitive verbs, as in most Indian
languages there is no verb <i>to be</i> used as a predicant or copula.
Where in English we would say <i>the man is good</i>, the Indian would
say <i>that man good</i>, using the adjective as an intransitive verb,
<i>i.e.</i>, as a predicant. If he desired to affirm it in the past
tense, the intransitive verb <i>good</i>, would be inflected, or
otherwise modified, to indicate the tense; and so, in like manner, all
adjectives when used to predicate can be modified to indicate mode,
tense, number, person, &amp;c., as other intransitive verbs.</p>

<p>Adverbs are used as intransitive verbs. In English we may say <i>he
is there</i>; the Indian would say <i>that person there</i> usually
preferring
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page011"> </a>
the demonstrative to the personal pronoun. The adverb <i>there</i>
would, therefore, be used as a predicant or intransitive verb, and might
be conjugated to denote different modes, tenses, numbers, persons, etc.
Verbs will often receive adverbial qualifications by the use of
incorporated particles, and, still further, verbs may contain within
themselves adverbial limitations without our being able to trace such
meanings to any definite particles or parts of the verb.</p>

<p>Prepositions are intransitive verbs. In English we may say <i>the hat
is on the table</i>; the Indian would say <i>that hat on table</i>; or
he might change the order, and say <i>that hat table on</i>; but the
preposition <i>on</i> would be used as an intransitive verb to
predicate, and may be conjugated. Prepositions may often be found as
particles incorporated in verbs, and, still further, verbs may contain
within themselves prepositional meanings without our being able to trace
such meanings to any definite particles within the verb. But the verb
connotes such ideas that something is needed to complete its meaning,
that something being a limiting or qualifying word, phrase, or clause.
Prepositions may be prefixed, infixed, or suffixed to nouns,
<i>i.e.</i>, they may be particles incorporated in nouns.</p>

<p>Nouns may be used as intransitive verbs under the circumstances when
in English we would use a noun as the complement of a sentence after the
verb <i>to be</i>.</p>

<p>The verb, therefore, often includes within itself subject, direct
object, indirect object, qualifier, and relation-idea. Thus it is that
the study of an Indian language is, to a large extent, the study of its
verbs.</p>

<p>Thus adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and nouns are used as
intransitive verbs; and, to such extent, adjectives, adverbs,
prepositions, nouns and verbs are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>From the remarks above, it will be seen that Indian verbs often
include within themselves meanings which in English are expressed by
adverbs and adverbial phrases and clauses. Thus the verb may express
within itself direction, manner, instrument, and purpose, one or all, as
the verb <i>to go</i> may be represented by a word signifying <i>go
home</i>; another, <i>go away from home</i>; another, <i>go to a place
other than home</i>; another, <i>go from a place other than home</i>;
one, <i>go from this place</i>, with reference to home; one, to <i>go
up</i>; another, to <i>go down</i>; one, <i>go around</i>; and, perhaps,
there will be a verb <i>go up hill</i>; another, <i>go up a valley</i>;
another, <i>go up a river</i>, etc. Then we may have <i>to go on
foot</i>, <i>to go on horseback</i>, <i>to go in a canoe</i>; still
another, <i>to go for water</i>; another <i>for wood</i>, etc. Distinct
words may be used for all these, or a fewer number used, and these
varied by incorporated particles. In like manner, the English verb <i>to
break</i> may be represented by several words, each of which will
indicate the manner of performing the act or the instrument with which
it is done. Distinct words may be used, or a common word varied with
incorporated particles.</p>

<p>The verb <i>to strike</i> may be represented by several words,
signifying
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page012"> </a>
severally <i>to strike with the fist</i>, <i>to strike with a club</i>,
<i>to strike with the open hand</i>, <i>to strike with a whip</i>, <i>to
strike with a switch</i>, to strike with a flat instrument, etc. A
common word may be used with incorporated particles or entirely
different words used.</p>

<p>Mode in an Indian tongue is a rather difficult subject. Modes
analogous to those of civilized tongues are found, and many conditions
and qualifications appear in the verb which in English and other
civilized languages appear as adverbs, and adverbial phrases and
clauses. No plane of separation can be drawn between such adverbial
qualifications and true modes. Thus there may be a form of the verb,
which shows that the speaker makes a declaration as certain,
<i>i.e.</i>, an <i>indicative</i> mode; another which shows that the
speaker makes a declaration with doubt, <i>i.e.</i>, a <i>dubitative</i>
mode; another that he makes a declaration on hearsay, <i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>quotative</i> mode; another form will be used in making a command,
giving an <i>imperative</i> mode; another in imploration, <i>i.e.</i>,
an <i>implorative</i> mode; another form to denote permission,
<i>i.e.</i>, a <i>permissive</i> mode; another in negation, <i>i.e.</i>,
a <i>negative</i> mode; another form will be used to indicate that the
action is simultaneous with some other action, <i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>simulative</i> mode; another to denote desire or wish that something
be done, <i>i.e.</i>, a <i>desiderative</i> mode; another that the
action ought to be done, <i>i.e.</i>, an <i>obligative</i> mode; another
that action is repetitive from time to time, <i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>frequentative</i> mode; another that action is caused, <i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>causative</i> mode, etc.</p>

<p>These forms of the verb, which we are compelled to call modes, are of
great number. Usually with each of them a particular modal particle or
incorporated adverb will be used; but the particular particle which
gives the qualified meaning may not always be discovered; and in one
language a different word will be introduced, wherein another the same
word will be used with an incorporated particle.</p>

<p>It is stated above that incorporated particles may be used to
indicate direction, manner, instrument, and purpose; in fact, any
adverbial qualification whatever may be made by an incorporated particle
instead of an adverb as a distinct word.</p>

<p>No line of demarkation can be drawn between these adverbial particles
and those mentioned above as modal particles. Indeed it seems best to
treat all these forms of the verb arising from, incorporated particles
as distinct modes. In this sense, then, an Indian language has a
multiplicity of modes. It should be further remarked that in many cases
these modal or adverbial particles are excessively worn, so that they
may appear as additions or changes of simple vowel or consonant sounds.
When incorporated particles are thus used, distinct adverbial words,
phrases, or clauses may also be employed, and the idea expressed
twice.</p>

<p>In an Indian language it is usually found difficult to elaborate a
system of tenses in paradigmatic form. Many tenses or time particles are
found incorporated in verbs. Some of these time particles are
excessively
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page013"> </a>
worn, and may appear rather as inflections than as incorporated
particles. Usually rather distinct present, past, and future tenses are
discovered; often a remote or ancient past, and less often an immediate
future. But great specification of time in relation to the present and
in relation to other time is usually found.</p>

<p>It was seen above that adverbial particles cannot be separated from
modal particles. In like manner tense particles cannot be separated from
adverbial and modal particles.</p>

<p>In an Indian language adverbs are differentiated only to a limited
extent. Adverbial qualifications are found in the verb, and thus there
are a multiplicity of modes and tenses, and no plane of demarcation can
be drawn between mode and tense. From preceding statements it will
appear that a verb in an Indian tongue may have incorporated with it a
great variety of particles, which can be arranged in three general
classes, <i>i.e.</i>, pronominal, adverbial, and prepositional.</p>

<p>The pronominal particles we have called article pronouns; they serve
to point out a variety of characteristics in the subject, object, and
indirect object of the verb. They thus subserve purposes which in
English are subserved by differentiated adjectives as distinct parts of
speech. They might, therefore, with some propriety, have been called
adjective particles, but these elements perform another function; they
serve the purpose which is usually called <i>agreement in language</i>;
that is, they make the verb agree with the subject and object, and thus
indicate the syntactic relation between subject, object, and verb. In
this sense they might with propriety have been called relation
particles, and doubtless this function was in mind when some of the
older grammarians called them transitions.</p>

<p>The adverbial particles perform the functions of voice, mode, and
tense, together with many other functions that are performed in
languages spoken by more highly civilized people by differentiated
adverbs, adverbial phrases, and clauses.</p>

<p>The prepositional particles perform the function of indicating a
great variety of subordinate relations, like the prepositions used as
distinct parts of speech in English.</p>

<p>By the demonstrative function of some of the pronominal particles,
they are closely related to adverbial particles, and adverbial particles
are closely related to prepositional particles, so that it will be
sometimes difficult to say of a particular particle whether it be
pronominal or adverbial, and of another particular particle whether it
be adverbial or prepositional.</p>

<p>Thus the three classes of particles are not separated by absolute
planes of demarkation.</p>

<p>The use of these particles as parts of the verb; the use of nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions as intransitive verbs; and the
direct use of verbs as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, make the study of
an Indian tongue to a large extent the study of its verbs.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page014"> </a>
To the extent that voice, mode, and tense are accomplished by the use of
agglutinated particles or inflections, to that extent adverbs and verbs
are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>To the extent that adverbs are found as incorporated particles in
verbs, the two parts of speech are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>To the extent that prepositions are particles incorporated in the
verb, prepositions and verbs are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>To the extent that prepositions are affixed to nouns, prepositions
and nouns are undifferentiated.</p>

<p>In all these particulars it is seen that the Indian tongues belong to
a very low type of organization. Various scholars have called attention
to this feature by describing Indian languages as being holophrastic,
polysynthetic, or synthetic. The term synthetic is perhaps the best, and
may be used as synonymous with undifferentiated.</p>

<p>Indian tongues, therefore, may be said to be highly synthetic in that
their parts of speech are imperfectly differentiated.</p>

<p>In these same particulars the English language is highly organized,
as the parts of speech are highly differentiated. Yet the difference is
one of degree, not of kind.</p>

<p>To the extent in the English language that inflection is used for
qualification, as for person, number, and gender of the noun and
pronoun, and for mode and tense in the verb, to that extent the parts of
speech are undifferentiated. But we have seen that inflection is used
for this purpose to a very slight extent.</p>

<p>There is yet in the English language one important differentiation
which has been but partially accomplished. Verbs as usually considered
are undifferentiated parts of speech; they are nouns and adjectives, one
or both, and predicants. The predicant simple is a distinct part of
speech. The English language has but one, the verb <i>to be</i>, and
this is not always a pure predicant, for it sometimes contains within
itself an adverbial element when it is conjugated for mode and tense,
and a connective element when it is conjugated for agreement. With
adjectives and nouns this verb is used as a predicant. In the passive
voice also it is thus used, and the participles are nouns or adjectives.
In what is sometimes called the progressive form of the active voice
nouns and adjectives are differentiated in the participles, and the verb
"to be" is used as a predicant. But in what is usually denominated the
active voice of the verb, the English language has undifferentiated
parts of speech. An examination of the history of the verb <i>to be</i>
in the English language exhibits the fact that it is coming more and
more to be used as the predicant; and what is usually called the common
form of the active voice is coming more and more to be limited in its
use to special significations.</p>

<p>The real active voice, indicative mode, present tense, first person,
singular number, of the verb to eat, is <i>am eating</i>. The expression
<i>I eat</i>, signifies <i>I am accustomed to eat</i>. So, if we
consider the common form of
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page015"> </a>
the active voice throughout its entire conjugation, we discover that
many of its forms are limited to special uses.</p>

<p>Throughout the conjugation of the verb the auxiliaries are
predicants, but these auxiliaries, to the extent that they are modified
for mode, tense, number, and person, contain adverbial and connective
elements.</p>

<p>In like manner many of the lexical elements of the English language
contain more than one part of speech: <i>To ascend</i> is <i>to go
up</i>; <i>to descend</i> is <i>to go down</i>; and <i>to depart</i> is
<i>to go from</i>.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that the English language is also synthetic in that
its parts of speech are not completely differentiated. The English,
then, differs in this respect from an Indian language only in
degree.</p>

<p>In most Indian tongues no pure predicant has been differentiated, but
in some the verb <i>to be</i>, or predicant, has been slightly
developed, chiefly to affirm, existence in a place.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that by the criterion of organization Indian
tongues are of very low grade.</p>

<p>It need but to be affirmed that by the criterion of sematologic
content Indian languages are of a very low grade. Therefore the
frequently-expressed opinion that the languages of barbaric peoples have
a more highly organized grammatic structure than the languages of
civilized peoples has its complete refutation.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that all paradigmatic inflection in a
civilized tongue is a relic of its barbaric condition. When the parts of
speech are fully differentiated and the process of placement fully
specialized, so that the order of words in sentences has its full
significance, no useful purpose is subserved by inflection.</p>

<p>Economy in speech is the force by which its development has been
accomplished, and it divides itself properly into economy of utterance
and economy of thought. Economy of utterance has had to do with the
phonic constitution of words; economy of thought has developed the
sentence.</p>

<p>All paradigmatic inflection requires unnecessary thought. In the
clause <i>if he was here</i>, <i>if</i> fully expresses the subjunctive
condition, and it is quite unnecessary to express it a second time by
using another form of the verb <i>to be</i>. And so the people who are
using the English language are deciding, for the subjunctive form is
rapidly becoming obsolete with the long list of paradigmatic forms which
have disappeared.</p>

<p>Every time the pronoun <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, or <i>it</i> is used it
is necessary to think of the sex of its antecedent, though in its use
there is no reason why sex should be expressed, say, one time in ten
thousand. If one pronoun non-expressive of gender were used instead of
the three, with three gender adjectives, then in nine thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine cases the speaker would be relieved of the
necessity of an unnecessary thought, and in the one case an adjective
would fully express it. But when these inflections are greatly
multiplied, as they are in the Indian languages, alike with the Greek
and Latin, the speaker is compelled in the
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page016"> </a>
choice of a word to express his idea to think of a multiplicity of
things which have no connection with that which he wishes to
express.</p>

<p>A <i>Ponka</i> Indian, in saying that a man killed a rabbit, would
have to say the man, he, one, animate, standing, in the nominative case,
purposely killed, by shooting an arrow, the rabbit, he, the one,
animate, sitting, in the objective case; for the form of a verb to kill
would have to be selected, and the verb changes its form by inflection
and incorporated particles to denote person, number, and gender as
animate or inanimate, and gender as standing, sitting, or lying, and
case; and the form of the verb would also express whether the killing
was done accidentally or purposely, and whether it was by shooting or by
some other process, and, if by shooting, whether by bow and arrow, or
with a gun; and the form of the verb would in like manner have to
express all of these things relating to the object; that is, the person,
number, gender, and case of the object; and from the multiplicity of
paradigmatic forms of the verb to kill this particular one would have to
be selected. Perhaps one time in a million it would be the purpose to
express all of these particulars, and in that case the Indian would have
the whole expression in one compact word, but in the nine hundred and
ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine cases all of these
particulars would have to be thought of in the selection of the form of
the verb, when no valuable purpose would be accomplished thereby.</p>

<p>In the development of the English, as well as the French and German,
linguistic evolution has not been in vain.</p>

<p>Judged by these criteria, the English stands alone in the highest
rank; but as a written language, in the way in which its alphabet is
used, the English has but emerged from a barbaric condition.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
